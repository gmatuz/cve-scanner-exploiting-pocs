# Exploiting WhiteSource through package manager arguments
Decompiling the [agent](https://github.com/whitesource/unified-agent-distribution/releases/download/v20.4.1.2/wss-unified-agent.jar ) you can find a lot of shell calls in WhiteSource as well. 
When they are trying to resolve some of the python/pip dependencies from `requirements.txt` files and the resolution does not work they start downloading the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file line-by-line
No input validation, no escaping, no paramaterization just good old string concatenation:
