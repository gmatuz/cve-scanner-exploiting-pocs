# Collection of some ideas and specific exploits against CVE scanners
You can read more on the background on the medium post. 

# tl dr
Most of scanners use a lot of shell, run package managers, if you run it on code you don't know you should expect it is similar to curl to bash
some of the scanner providers don't consider this an issue, they (probably rightly) expect people to expect this
However keep this in mind whenever you use the tools especially if you add it to CI/CD or other security automation where it might become an issue

#Ideas if you have to exploit such tools or think about how attackers would
* Anchore runs as a service, attacking it is more interesting. They do not run package managers but there are shell shananigans non the less. This leads us to [CVE-2020-11075](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11075), which is specific to them but [shows how scanning docker images is hard to defend](https://github.com/gmatuz/cve-scanner-pocs/tree/master/anchore).
* For scanners, such as FOSSA, Snyk or WhiteSource, that run packaga managers directly to resolve dependencies, you can obviously run commands through gradlew of Podfiles, this is simple way to attack them.
* The [example of Snyk](https://github.com/gmatuz/cve-scanner-pocs/tree/master/snyk/docker) shows how running docker commands to examine the images can result in code execution. But in general shelling out often is usually a [bad idea](https://github.com/gmatuz/cve-scanner-pocs/tree/master/snyk/go) for security.
* Similarly exploits on WhiteSource shows how you can execute commands either by [tricky directory names](https://github.com/gmatuz/cve-scanner-pocs/tree/master/whitesource/generic) or again injecting into [values that will be arguments for shell commands](https://github.com/gmatuz/cve-scanner-pocs/tree/master/whitesource/pip).
