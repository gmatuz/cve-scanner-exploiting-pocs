# Running OS commands through CocoaPods 
I think the issue is in a closed source component inly run by the FOSSA server `srclib-iOS `. What it does again is directly executes the `Podfile` that is provided in the project
You can add shell commands to a Podfile as `system("shellcommand")`, don't forget to make it executable.
