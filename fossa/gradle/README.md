# Running OS commands through gradlew in FOSSA
This is very unglamorous: FOSSA directly runs the `gradlew` file (don't forget to make it executable). For it  to work you will have to create a non-empty `build.gradle` file.
To test you should run `fossa init` in this directory and find the file that is created

# Fix
This was not considered a security issue by the vendor. As such, it was not fixed.
