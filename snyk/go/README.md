# Running OS commands through go 
Snyk when evaluating your go dependencies takes the [ignored packages](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-go-plugin/blob/a10a950cceaf025ca92e5144f7de15372b08c50b/lib/index.ts#L147) and passes them to a [shell](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-go-plugin/blob/a10a950cceaf025ca92e5144f7de15372b08c50b/lib/index.ts#L151). Just add whatever command you would like into the `ignored` array in the `Gopkg.toml`; to hit the code path you will also need a valid `Gopkg.lock` file.
To test you should run `snyk test` in this directory and find the file that is created
