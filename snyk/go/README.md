# Running OS commands in Snyk through go 
Snyk when evaluating your go dependencies takes the [ignored packages](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-go-plugin/blob/a10a950cceaf025ca92e5144f7de15372b08c50b/lib/index.ts#L147) and passes them to a [shell](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-go-plugin/blob/a10a950cceaf025ca92e5144f7de15372b08c50b/lib/index.ts#L151). 
```js
      ignorePkgsParam = '-ignoredPkgs=' + config.ignoredPkgs.join(',');
    }
    const args = ['run', goResolveTool, ignorePkgsParam];
    debug('executing go deps resolver', {cmd: 'go' + args.join(' ')});
    const graphStr = await subProcess.execute(
      'go',
      args,
      {cwd: root},
    );
```
Just add whatever command you would like into the `ignored` array in the `Gopkg.toml`; to hit the code path you will also need a valid `Gopkg.lock` file.
To test you should run `snyk test` in this directory and find the file that is created

# Fix
This was not considered a security issue by the vendor. As such, it was not fixed.
